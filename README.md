#notice
I've just noticed that I do not enjoy writing news headlines as much as I thought, so for the time being I am done with writing articles, but please if you are interested, please send me over an article.

# What-you-need-to-know
WYNK, is a open source simple news website, providing you breaking news.
I plan to make the site as transparent as possible, giving people important things they need to know while filtering out biases, inaccuracies and fear mongering as much as possible while still giving users the most important news in less than a few pages.

# Contribute
This project will be open for anybody to contribute to. Please use a pull request or an issue. Feedback is encouraged!
Please send me over any articles you have and I will approve the ones that are the best.
